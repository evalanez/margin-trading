All about margin trading

Margin trading is a method of trading assets using funds 
provided by a third party. When compared to regular 
trading accounts, margin accounts allow traders to access 
greater sums of capital, allowing them to leverage their positions. 
Essentially, margin trading amplifies trading results so that 
traders are able to realize larger profits on successful trades. 
This ability to expand trading results makes margin trading 
especially popular in low-volatility markets, 
particularly the international Forex market.
still, margin trading is also used in stock,
commodity, and cryptocurrency markets.
